# Project Overview: Games Data Analytics & Machine Learning

This project is an **end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline** applied to video games data. The goal is to extract actionable insights, create visualizations, and build predictive models for games sales and classification. 

The project includes:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Raw game datasets were collected, cleaned, and preprocessed for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Patterns, trends, and correlations in games sales, genres, publishers, and platforms were explored.  
3. **SQL Analysis:** Data was loaded into SQL Server to answer business questions using queries and aggregations.  
4. **Power BI Reporting:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created to provide insights on sales, genres, publishers, and regional performance.  
5. **Machine Learning:** Classification and regression models were built in Python to predict game performance and categorize games.  
6. **Deployment:** The ML model is ready for deployment with saved pipelines for inference.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a **data-driven analytics solution**, from raw data to actionable insights and predictive modeling.
